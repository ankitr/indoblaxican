        <h1>Welcome to the Indo-Blaxican</h1>
        <p>We gave up on site design, and decided to focus on the food.</p>
        <h2>Menu</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Curry-Sautéed Fried Chicken Tacos</li>
            <li>Watermelon & Mango Fruit Salad</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We're still thinking of ideas before we start delivery. <a href="mailto:me@ankit.io">Hit us up</a> if you have ideas for some Indo-Blaxican cuisine.</p>
        <h2>Team</h2>
        <p>We have a team of four (Welcome Aman!) specialized culinary artists that will blow your mind with their concoctions. If you think you have what it takes, you should consider joining us.</p>
